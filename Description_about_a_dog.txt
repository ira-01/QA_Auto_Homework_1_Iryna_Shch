This dog is not an ideal companion.

WHY
=======================================================
he is apathetic towards the owner and barks excessively at people. 
He is not well-trained, does not follow commands reliably, 
and misbehaves both at home and outside. 
He doesn't play,
and isn't protective of his family and home.
