This dog is the ideal and perfect companion.

WHY
=======================================================
He is always excited to see his owner, wagging his tail 
and greeting them with joy. 
He is well-trained, follows commands reliably, 
and behaves well both at home and outside. 
He enjoys playing, provides comfort, 
and is protective of his family and home.
My best friend!
